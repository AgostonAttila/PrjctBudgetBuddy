Personal finance app with multiple clients.
Focusing on what's new in **Dotnet 8** , **Angular 17** , **NextJs14** no complicated logic just keep it simple

None of the projects are ready and are very deficient from a security point of view, as they are only of a test nature, so they are not suitable for use in production

**Server**:

- ASP.NET Core WebAPI (Dotnet8) Bearer new default API endpoint (AddIdentityApiEndpoints)
- ASP.NET Core WebAPI (Dotnet8) JWT with usermanager and singinmanager

**Clients**:

- Blazor Dotnet 8
- Blazor with server part (new identity pages etc.)
- MAUI Dotnet 8 (Hybrid)
- Angular 17
- React 18 (Vite)
- NextJs 14 (without server)
- React Native with expo
- Vue

**Maybe later**:

- NextJs with server part
- Electron
- Ionic
